# Part of flying etiquette survey results

This is an insight into one of the [*FiveThirtyEight*](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/flying-etiquette-survey) flight etiquette survey results of whether passengers find seat reclining rude. 

## Why this piece of data was chosen to be highlighted

Although this survey included a variety of interesting questions and results, this particular question stood out as walking a fine line between rudeness and neutrality. Reclining one's seat on the airplane is an action due to comfort and relaxation, though it can annoy passengers in the back row quite extensively. With this in mind, the results of this question were particularly fascinating.
